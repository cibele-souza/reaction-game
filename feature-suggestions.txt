Prioritize features by player value and implementation cost:

Difficulty scaling & progressive levels — increases replayability (medium).
Persistent high scores, player profiles & achievements — retention (low).
Sound effects + music + toggle settings — polish (low).
Touch / mobile support (tap regions) + configurable input mapping — reach & accessibility (medium).
Multiplayer (local hotseat or simple WebSocket matchmaking) — big engagement boost (high).
Power-ups / modifiers (slow time, double points) — variety (medium).
Visual polish: particle effects, animations, transition UI — perceived quality (low).
Accessibility: colorblind mode, scalable fonts, screenreader labels — inclusiveness (low).
Leaderboard (local + optional cloud) with anti-cheat basics — competitiveness (medium).
Replay / ghost system (show previous run) — learning & fun (high).
Analytics & telemetry for gameplay tuning (opt-in) — data-driven improvements (low).
Localization framework + a couple language translations — broader audience (low).
Unit tests & CI pipeline for core logic (timing, scoring) — reliability (low).
Packaging: build scripts for Windows exe / web deploy / PWA — distribution (medium).
Implementation hints (short):

Difficulty scaling: increase target speed or reduce reaction windows per level; centralize difficulty constants in a single config module.
Persistence: save scores and settings to localStorage (or file for desktop). Use JSON schema and simple versioning.
Touch input: abstract input layer so clicks, keypress, and touches call the same handlers.
Sound: preload audio buffers, play via small audio manager with volume/pause controls.
Multiplayer: start with local hotseat rounds, later add a simple Node WebSocket server for latency-tolerant turns.
Leaderboards: implement local first; add optional server endpoint later. Validate scores on server if using cloud.
Tests: add unit tests for timing & scoring functions (Jest or your test runner), and end-to-end smoke tests for major flows.
